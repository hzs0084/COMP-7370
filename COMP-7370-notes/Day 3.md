One topic on something of my choosing

A presentation in-front of the class

Pick 2 to 3 papers and review their methods/solutions in good detail using your own language

all the papers that you need to do extensive reading, you need to make sure not to spend more than 45 minutes on this

Summarize the key point of the paper in two sentences. If you can't then you don't understand the paper and their key point. 

I need to read at least 40 papers. The minimum number suggested is 20. 

Final Project:

	- Analytical study of a research problem
	- Simulation that will help to answer a problem
	- The development of a system (hardware and/or software) that will help to achieve a functionality or answer a problem.
